# python-templates
Collection Of Python Modules For General Use

## Why Was This Created
In an effort to build my public portfolio, I decided to recreate code that I have found useful. Potential upcoming code snippets:

- [] Jinja template to read in a table
- [] manipulation of data from a CSV or XLSX
- [] html view of data based on weighted information

... TBD

# Code Sections
Here you will find the current code snippets and short explanations of each.
